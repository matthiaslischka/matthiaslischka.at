title: Revisiting the Agile Principles

Do you still remember the twelve principles of the _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_? Me neither! At least not until they somehow popped up on my screen last weekend. And my first reaction:

![Say agile one more time. I dare you, I double dare you!](/assets/posts/say-agile-one-more-time.jpg)

Then I started to think about what each principle would mean for me in an ideal world and how I have sacrificed almost every single one of them at some point in time.


 > #1 Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.<br />
 
 **Satisfy the customer through valuable software**
- Do not just build what the customer wants but what he needs.
- Create value with your software.
- Do not try to sell CRs for the sole purpose of making more money. Increase the value of the software.
 
 > #2 Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
 
**Welcome changing requirements**
- Seek feedback all the time and as early as possible.
- Don't be afraid to raise concerns even late in development.
- Talking about the budget or CRs too early can disturb or destory rather meaningful discussions.
 
 > #3 Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
 
**Deliver working software frequently**
- Deliver - not only present. Provide a running and stable system with the latest features that the customer can use.
- Make it part of the process that the customer plays around with the new features and gives feedback.
- Try to get real user as soon as possible (MVP) - Only real users will give real feedback.

 > #4 Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
 
**Work together daily**
- Do not work in isolation.
- Work as a pair or group whenever useful.
- Use reviews of all kind to share knowledge and get feedback.
- The team is not only the devs. Work closely together with POs, testers, UX and the customer (if possible).
- Share a team room whenever possible.
- Communicate with the whole team. Not just about business but also personal matters.
- When working remote create space for interhuman relations. A team needs some off topic chit-chat!

 > #5 Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
 
**Motivated individuals**
- Feedback-loops to increase recognition and gratitude.
- Help individuals to accomplish personal goals.
- Celebrate successes and embrace failure.
 
 > #6 The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
 
**Face-to-face conversations**
- Provide room and tools for collaboration.
- Avoid misunderstandings and communication problems:<br />
Face to face > phone call > instant message > mail.
 
 > #7 Working software is the primary measure of progress.

**Working software is progress**
- Functional valuable features delivered and customer satisfaction is true progress.
- Other things can be measured and evaluated but at the end of the day that's what counts.

 > #8 Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

**A sustainable pace you can maintain indefinitely**
- Do never(*) work overtime.
- "Sprint" is a stupid word. You should not be exhausted after every iteration.
- Find a pace that the team can maintain long time without burnout. Including holidays and sick leave.
 
 (*) _Never_ is a strong word only used here to make a catchy statement. Common sense, people.

 > #9 Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

**Technical excellence and good design**
- Time invested in good design is almost priceless.
- Encourage knowledge exchange and discussions.
- [Throw away early](https://vimeo.com/108441214), refactor later.
- Don't shy away from taking external help in the early stage if needed.

 > #10 Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.

**Simplicity - maximizing the amount of work not done**
- Find the bare essence of the requirements.
- Reduce unnecessary noise and gold plating.
- Clarify what is required to satisfy the need. Aim for clear goals.
- Deliver fast, get feedback, improve. (80/20 rule)

 > #11 The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

**Self-organizing teams**

This seems to be the hardest and totally uncommon: Let the team decide how it will work - not the management.
- Let the team decide on the best fitting team composition according to circumstances.
- Scrum as a guideline not a dogma.
- Agile does not have to mean Scrum at all.
- Sprints do not have to be two weeks.
- Not every team needs a Scrum Master.
- The standup is for the team not the management.
- Definition of Done is defined by the team and maybe not even necessary.
- Do not dictate a quality assurance workflow. Hold the team accountable for the results.
- Provide the team with some fun-budget - no questions asked.

 > #12 At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

**Reflect on how to become more effective**
- Not just in the retrospective meeting. Start listening to the problems mentioned in the daily standup.
- Put some effort into retrospectives.
- Always derive [smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) actions.
- Pain that "can't be changed" can be changed almost always.
- Automate to save time and reduce errors.
- When something is painful do it more often. Releasing a new version is painful? Do it every week friday afternoon. Automate and streamline until it runs so smoothly you hardly even notice it anymore.

In software development "_Agile_" is like the ugliest word of the year - every year. A buzzword so misused that many devs are sick of hearing it. But besides all that consultant gibberish I think from time to time we all should remember what _agile_ originally stood for - true values.

Now that was a nice refreshment. I plan to update this list from time to time now. Maybe I can add some more hands-on points over time.
