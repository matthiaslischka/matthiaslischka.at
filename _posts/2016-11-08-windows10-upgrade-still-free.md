[Windows 10 free upgrade](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade) for customers who use assistive technologies. You don't really have to use assistive technologies though! 

Just click "UPGRADE NOW" and there you go. If your Upgrade stucks at 99% you might have to install your Windows 7/8 Updates first.
